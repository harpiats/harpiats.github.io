description: A guide to commands and scaffold of harpia framework.
---

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Harpia Framework provides a set of commands to streamline development. These commands are defined in the `package.json` file:

| Command   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start`   | Starts the application.                                                     |
| `dev`     | Starts the application in development mode with hot-reloading.              |
| `tests`   | Runs tests for a specific module or directory (e.g., `user/store`).         |
| `lint`    | Runs lint for a specific module or file (e.g., `user/controller/store`).    |
| `g`       | Generates modules, files, and other scaffolding components.                 |
| `studio`  | Starts Prisma Studio for database management.                               |
| `seed`    | Runs database seed scripts.                                                 |
| `migrate` | Generates prisma client types and applies all pending database migrations.  |
| `deploy`  | Generates prisma client types and applies all pending database migrations.  |

> You can run the `tests` command like `bun tests user` to execute all tests within the `user` module.
> To run tests sequentially, add the `--runInBand` flag, for example: `bun tests user --runInBand`.
>
> The `lint` command can be used on a specific module, directory, or file. For example:
>
> * `bun lint user` lints the entire `user` module.
> * `bun lint user/controller` lints the `controller` directory within the `user` module.
> * `bun lint user/controller/store` lints a specific file.


## Scaffold
The Harpia Framework includes a powerful scaffolding system to help you generate commonly used application components with ease. This tool accelerates development and enforces a consistent structure across your codebase.

You can invoke the scaffolding tool using the following command:

```bash
bun g
```

Or if you prefer, you can use the shorthand:

```bash
bun g <type>
```

Where `<type>` can be one of the following:
- `module`
- `controller`
- `test`
- `factory`
- `seed`
- `task`
- `validation`
- `observer`

## Examples

Upon execution, you'll be prompted to select what you want to generate:

```bash
? What do you want to forge? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Module
  Controller
  Test
  Factory
  Seed
  Task
  Validation
  Observer
```

Or you can specify the type directly:

```bash
bun g module
```

### Module
The `Module` option scaffolds a complete directory structure for a new feature or resource in your application. A typical module includes controllers, views, services, tests, and more, organized as follows:

<FileTree>
- your-module-name
  - controllers
    - index.ts
    - create.ts
    - destroy.ts
    - edit.ts
    - list.ts
    - show.ts
    - store.ts
    - update.ts
  - pages
    - create
      - page.html
    - edit
      - page.html
    - list
      - page.html
    - show
      - page.html
  - repositories
    - index.ts
    - create.ts
    - destroy.ts
    - list.ts
    - show.ts
    - update.ts
  - services
    - index.ts
    - create.ts
    - destroy.ts
    - list.ts
    - show.ts
    - update.ts
  - tests
    - .gitignore
  - validations
      - index.ts
      - create.ts
      - update.ts
  - **your-module-name.routes.ts**
</FileTree>

> 🛠️ Note: The pages/ directory is only generated if the application is running in MODE=fullstack. If the mode is set to MODE=api, the pages/ directory will not be included.

This layout promotes modular development, making your application easier to scale and maintain by clearly separating responsibilities.

### Controller

Harpia lets you scaffold generic controller files with just one command:

```bash
bun g controller
```

Choose the `Test` option, then specify the module and test name.  
Example:

```bash
✔ Module name: user
✔ Controller name: generic
```

This creates a new file at:  
`modules/user/controllers/generic.ts`


### Test

Harpia lets you scaffold ready-to-use test files with just one command:

```bash
bun g
```

Choose the `Test` option, then specify the module and test name.  
Example:

```bash
✔ What do you want to forge? Test
✔ Module name: user
✔ Test name: store
```

This creates a new file at:  
`modules/user/tests/store.spec.ts`

Each test file comes pre-configured with `bun:test` and the `TestClient` utility to help you get started quickly.

### Factory

The `Factory` option scaffolds a factory class used to generate seed data for your models.  
To create a new factory, run the command:

```bash
bun g
```

Then choose the `Factory` option:

```bash
? What do you want to forge? (Use arrow keys)
  Module
  Controller
  Test
❯ Factory
  Seed
  Task
  Validation
  Observer
```

You’ll be prompted to enter a factory name, typically matching the model it’s for:

```bash
✔ What do you want to forge? Factory  
✔ Factory name (use a model name): user
```

This will generate a new file at:  
`app/database/factories/user.factory.ts`

The generated file comes with a base structure like this:

```ts
import { Factory } from "app/helpers/Factory";
import { User } from "..";

const UserFactory = new Factory().define(User, (faker) => {
  return {
    /**
     * Define your model fields here using faker.js.
     * 
     * Example:
     * name: faker.person.fullName(),
     */
  };
});

export { UserFactory }
```

Factories include five core methods:

- `.create()` – Creates and persists one record to the database.
- `.createMany(count)` – Creates and persists multiple records.
- `.makeStubbed()` – Generates one record's data without saving it.
- `.makeStubbedMany(count)` – Generates multiple records’ data without saving.
- `.merge(data)` – Merges custom fields with generated data (works with all other methods).

Here’s an example of how to use a factory:

```ts
import { UserFactory } from "app/database/factories/user.factory";

await UserFactory.create();
await UserFactory.createMany(2);

const user = await UserFactory.makeStubbed();
const users = await UserFactory.makeStubbedMany(5);

await UserFactory.merge({ name: "John Doe" }).create();
const customUser = await UserFactory.merge({ name: "John Doe" }).makeStubbed();
```

> 💡 You can use factories in your [tests](/guides/tests) and [seeders](/guides/seeders) to generate reliable and consistent mock data during development.

### Seed

Seeding is the process of populating your database with initial data — useful for development, testing, or simply bootstrapping your application with some default content.  
Harpia provides a powerful and flexible seeding system that integrates seamlessly with factories, allowing you to generate realistic data with ease.

You can generate seed files using the `bun g` command, or create them manually for full control over the data flow.

> 📖 Check out the [full seeding guide](/guides/seeding) to learn how to create, run, and structure your seed files effectively.

### Tasks and Jobs

Harpia supports background processing and scheduled tasks using the powerful [`cron`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cron) library. Tasks are placed in the `app/tasks` directory and can be easily scaffolded using the `bun g` command.

Each task is a `CronJob` instance and runs on a schedule you define — perfect for background processing, database cleanup, notifications, and more.

> 📖 For a complete walkthrough, check the [full guide on Tasks and Jobs](/guides/tasks-and-jobs).

### Validation

Harpia uses the [Zod](https://zod.dev/) library for schema-based validation, providing a powerful and type-safe way to ensure that data conforms to expected formats before processing.


#### Scaffolding a Validation

You can generate a custom validation file using the `bun g` command:

```bash
bun g
```

Then select the `Validation` option:

```bash
? What do you want to forge? (Use arrow keys)
  Module
  Controller
  Test
  Factory
  Seed
  Task
❯ Validation
  Observer

✔ Module name: user
✔ Validation name: create
```

This will generate a new file at:

```
modules/user/validations/create.ts
```

With the following structure:

```ts
import AppError from "app/helpers/AppError";
import * as z from "zod";

export const Schema = z.object({
  // name: z.string().min(1).max(255),
});

export type SchemaType = z.infer<typeof Schema>;

export async function create(data: SchemaType) {
  try {
    Schema.parse(data);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof z.ZodError || error instanceof AppError) {
      throw error;
    }

    throw AppError.E_GENERIC_ERROR("Unexpected error during validation.");
  }
}
```

---

#### Default Validators on Module Creation

When generating a new `Module` using `bun g`, Harpia automatically creates two default validation files:

- `create.ts`
- `update.ts`

These files are located in:

```
modules/[module]/validations/
```

They are also automatically exported through the module’s `index.ts` file:

```ts
import { create } from "./create";
import { update } from "./update";

export const validation = {
  create,
  update,
};
```

This structure makes it easy to reuse validation logic consistently across your controllers or services.

---

> 💡 **Tip:** You can enhance your validations using Zod features like `.refine()`, `.superRefine()`, `.transform()`, or schema composition for advanced use cases.

### Observers

Harpia provides a simple and powerful way to hook into Prisma lifecycle events using **Observers**. These let you react to model-level database operations such as `create`, `update`, `delete`, and more.

Observers live in the `app/observers` directory and are automatically registered when the application boots.

You can scaffold a new observer with:

```bash
bun g
```

---

Use observers to:

- Log database activity  
- Send notifications or emails  
- Sync data with external APIs or services  

Each observer is defined by attaching a callback to a Prisma operation on a specific model:

```ts
// app/observers/user.observer.ts
import { Observer } from ".";

Observer.model("User", "create", ({ data }) => {
  console.log("New user created:", data);
});
```

> 🔗 **Learn more:** [Observer Documentation](/guides/observers)

### Authentication

Harpia supports secure, session-based authentication out of the box.

Use this command to scaffold the necessary files:

```bash
bun g --config session
```
