title: S3 Service
description: A wrapper around Bun's native S3Client for uploading, reading, and managing files in S3-compatible storage.
---

Harpia includes a first-class service for interacting with Amazon S3 (or compatible storage providers like MinIO and DigitalOcean Spaces) using Bun’s built-in `S3Client`. The `S3Service` provides a convenient API for file uploads, downloads, streaming, deletion, and presigned URLs.

> ℹ️ This is powered by Bun’s native [S3Client](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3), meaning it does not require any external AWS SDK.
> When using non-AWS providers (like MinIO or DigitalOcean Spaces), make sure to set a custom endpoint URL.

---

## Quickstart

Here are some common use cases to get started quickly:

```ts
// Assume S3Service is already initialized

// Upload
await s3.send("notes/hello.txt", "Hello, world!", { type: "text/plain" });

// Read as text
const content = await s3.readAsText("notes/hello.txt");

// Read as JSON
const json = await s3.readAsJson<{ title: string }>("data/post.json");

// Delete
await s3.delete("notes/hello.txt");

// Upload large file
await s3.sendLargeFile("videos/big.mp4", buffer, { partSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024 });

// Generate presigned URL
const url = s3.generatePresignedUrl("notes/hello.txt", { expiresIn: 3600 });
```

---

## Configuration

To use the `S3Service`, you must configure it with your S3 credentials:

```ts
import { S3Service } from "app/services/s3";

const s3 = new S3Service({
  bucket: "my-bucket",
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID!,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!,
  region: "us-east-1",
  endpoint: "https://s3.amazonaws.com", // optional for AWS
});
```

---

## Uploading a File

```ts
await s3.send("uploads/image.png", fileBuffer, {
  type: "image/png",
  acl: "public-read",
});
```

---

## Reading Files

### As text:

```ts
const text = await s3.readAsText("docs/readme.txt");
```

### As JSON:

```ts
const json = await s3.readAsJson<{ name: string }>("data/user.json");
```

### As binary:

```ts
const buffer = await s3.readAsArrayBuffer("archive.zip");
```

### Partial content:

```ts
const excerpt = await s3.readPartial("bigfile.txt", 0, 100);
```

---

## Deleting Files

```ts
await s3.delete("uploads/old-image.jpg");
```

---

## Uploading Large Files

Use `sendLargeFile()` to stream large content in parts:

```ts
await s3.sendLargeFile("videos/long.mp4", videoBuffer, {
  partSize: 10 * 1024 * 1024, // 10MB chunks
  queueSize: 5,
  acl: "private",
});
```

---

## Generating a Presigned URL

```ts
const url = s3.generatePresignedUrl("uploads/photo.jpg", {
  expiresIn: 3600, // 1 hour
  acl: "public-read",
  method: "GET",
});
```

This URL can be shared with clients to securely access files without exposing sensitive credentials.

---

## File References

The `.file(key)` method returns a `S3File` reference:

```ts
const file = s3.file("docs/manual.pdf");

await file.exists();
await file.delete();
await file.write("Hello World");
```

Useful when you need finer control using the underlying Bun `S3File` API.

---

## Error Handling

If credentials are missing or invalid, an error with code `ERR_S3_MISSING_CREDENTIALS` will be thrown:

```ts
try {
  await s3.send("path", buffer);
} catch (error) {
  if ((error as any).code === "ERR_S3_MISSING_CREDENTIALS") {
    // Handle credential error
  }
}
```

---

## When to Use

The `S3Service` is a great fit when:

- You want to upload or read files from S3 without external dependencies
- You need to stream large files efficiently
- You require secure access via presigned URLs
- You want native S3 support with excellent performance and simplicity
