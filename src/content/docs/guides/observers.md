title: Observers
description: A guide in my new Starlight docs site.

Model observers in Harpia let you hook into Prisma operations—such as creating, updating, or deleting records—and run custom logic when those actions occur.
Observers are stored in the `app/observers` directory and are automatically loaded when the application starts. You can create one using the scaffold command:

```bash
bun g
```

## When to Use

Observers are helpful for:

- Logging database changes
- Triggering side effects (like sending notifications)
- Integrating with third-party services

## Supported Operations

You can observe any of the following Prisma operations:

- findUnique
- findUniqueOrThrow
- findFirst
- findFirstOrThrow
- findMany
- create
- createMany
- createManyAndReturn
- delete
- update
- deleteMany
- updateMany
- updateManyAndReturn
- upsert
- aggregate
- groupBy
- count

## Example Setup
Each observer is just a file that registers a callback for a model and operation.

```typescript
// app/observers/UserCreate.observer.ts
import { Observer } from ".";

Observer.model("User", "create", ({ data }) => {
  console.log("New user created:", data);
});
```
